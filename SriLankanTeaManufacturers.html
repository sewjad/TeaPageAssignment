      <li><a href="https://www.pureceylontea.com/"><h3>Ceylon Tea</h3></a></li>
      <img id="ceylonT" src="images/ceylontea.jpg">
      <p>In 1873, Ceylon Tea made its international debut when twenty-three 
        pounds of tea produced by James Taylor reached London.
        In 1884, the Central Tea Factory was built on the 
        Fairyland Estate (Pedro) in Nuwara Eliya.
        In 1932, the Ceylon Tea Propaganda Board was established.
        To commemorate 125 years of Ceylon Tea, an international convention was 
        held in Colombo in 1992. The Tea Research Board was formed. 
        Export duties and Ad Valorem Taxes were abolished.
        With the closure of the London Tea Auction in 1998, 
        the trade in Ceylon Tea centred solely on the Colombo Auction.In 1999, 
        the Sri Lanka Tea Board globally trademarked the 
        Lion logo as an emblem of 100% Pure Ceylon Tea.
        The year 2017 marked the 150th year of Ceylon Tea. 
        Since James Taylor established the first commercial plantation in 1867, 
        the Sri Lankan tea industry has come a long way, 
        now generating over USD 1 billion in 
        export revenue and employing over 1 million citizens.</p>

      <img id="dilmahT" src="images/dilmah.jpg">
      <p>Sri Lankan family tea company Dilmah, founded by Merrill J. Fernando, 
        today the world's most experienced teamaker, has championed quality, 
        authenticity and variety in tea. Dilmah pioneered the concept of Single Origin 
        Tea in 1988 when the family company went against industry trends to declare its 
        commitment to authenticity. Garden fresh, unblended tea is a hallmark of 
        Dilmah and offers a unique taste of unblended Ceylon Tea packed at source.</p>
      <li><a href="https://gsteas.lk/"><h3>George Steuarts Tea</h3></a></li>
      <img id="gsT" src="images/steuarts.jpg">
      <p>Established in 1835 by brothers James and George Steuart,George Steuart & 
        Company stands proud today as the oldest mercantile establishment in Sri Lanka. 
        In its span of nearly two centuries George Steuart & Company has made immense 
        contributions to establish Sri Lanka as one of world's foremost producers of finest quality teas.
        The company has paid great attention to maintaining its distinction from the rich 
        British traditions it finds its roots in, a testament of which is the company's 
        dedication to preserving the artistry of tea making, exacting the standards of the 
        British Empire and its aristocratic flair blended with the signature goodness of pure 
        Ceylon tea. A SINGLE ORIGIN TEA renowned the world over for its excellence, sourced from 
        the lush tea gardens of the hill country where handpicked tea buds and leaves are 
        transformed into the aromatic indulgence that is "Steuarts Tea". Vivaciously full-bodied, 
        distinctly flavoured, and abundant in nutrients, Steuart Teas hark back to that era when 
        Ceylon tea delighted the senses of the British noblemen.</p>
      <li><a href="https://www.bogawantalawa.com/"><h3>Bogawanthalawa Tea</h3></a></li>
      <img id="bogawanthalawaT" src="images/bogawanthalawa.jpg">
      <p>The history of Bogawantalawa is traced back to 1869. 
        It was during this time that pioneering Scottish planters 
        came across a valley surrounded by mountains encircled by lush and 
        forests, quite unlike anything else witnessed…
        Coffee was initially grown here – however, with the blight that 
        obliterated it, tea planting commenced instead. 
        It was soon discovered that the Extremely fertile soil, 
        elevation ranging from 4,500 to 6,000 with unique microclimatic 
        conditions, provided the perfect terroir to produce the most exquisite 
        teas of distinct character, flavor and body that soon became 
        prized world over. Bogawantalawa has since been termed the Golden 
        Valley of Ceylon Tea…!!</p>
