    <h2>Types of Tea</h2>
    <p>Tea is a name given to a lot of beverages, 
      but conservatives consider only green tea, black tea, white tea, oolong tea, 
      and pu-erh tea the original. They are all taken from the Camellia 
      sinensis plant, a shrub native to China and India, 
      and include unique antioxidants known as flavonoids. 
      The most effective of these, known as ECGC(epigallocatechin-3-gallate), may help against free 
      radicals that can aid to cancer, heart disease, 
      and clogged arteries
      All these teas also have caffeine and theanine, 
      which affect the brain and seem to enhance mental alertness.
